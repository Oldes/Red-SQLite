# Red-SQLite
SQLite binding for Red and Red/System

---
I removed all files from this repository, as it is redundant.

If you need this binding, use [official Red/Code repository](https://github.com/red/code/tree/master/Library/SQLite) or [my fork](https://github.com/red/code/tree/master/Library/SQLite), which may contain changes not yet merged in the main repository.
