# Red-SQLite
SQLite binding for Red and Red/System

---
SQLite is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine.

Purpose of this project is to provide access to **SQLite API** from Red/System and Red language.

[SQLite3.reds](SQLite3.reds) is full low level API for **Red/System** made by parsing of SQLite3 header file (v3.18.0) with manual review.
[SQLite3.red](SQLite3.red) is minimal binding with dialect for **Red** level and could be used as a starting point for more complex work.
